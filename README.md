## Bioinformatics Tools (bit)
These are a collection of one-liners and short scripts I use frequently enough that it's been worth it for me to have them instantly available anywhere. This includes things like: 
1. downloading NCBI assemblies in different formats by just providing accession numbers (`bit-dl-ncbi-assemblies`) 
2. pulling out sequences by their coordinates (`bit-extract-seqs-by-coords`)
3. splitting a fasta file based on headers (`bit-parse-fasta-by-headers`)
4. renaming sequences in a fasta (`bit-rename-fasta-headers`)
5. pulling amino acid or nucleotide sequences out of a GenBank file (`bit-genbank-to-AA-seqs` / `bit-genbank-to-fasta` )

And other just convenient things to have handy like removing those annoying soft line wraps that some fasta files have (`bit-remove-wraps`) and printing out the column names of a TSV with numbers (`bit-colnames`) to quickly see which columns need to be provided to things like `cut` or `awk`. Some require [biopython](https://biopython.org/wiki/Download) and [pybedtools](https://pypi.org/project/pybedtools/), but all is taken care of if you use the the conda installation ðŸ™‚

## Conda install

```
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c astrobiomike bit
```

Each command has a help menu accessible by either entering the command alone or by providing `-h` as the only argument. Once installed, you can see all available commands by entering `bit-` and pressing tab twice.
